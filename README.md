# Star Wars Genesis Core Gameplay Changes

#### While striving to be a Total Conversion, Star Wars Genesis also fixes, improves, and builds upon many vanilla aspects of the game. This serves as an overview of all those changes as well a deterrent for those referring to Star Wars Genesis as simply a reskin of vanilla Starfield.

## Main Story and other Quests
While also addressing the loopholes in the vanilla Starfield story by completely rewriting it, Star Wars Genesis features many additional aspects beyond a rewrite.
- Additional Main Story Boss with Dark Souls mechanics
- Additional dialogue variety beyond vanilla Starfield
- Alternate Choices in Key Quests (side against Paradiso, rob all the money in Kryx mission, etc)
- Supporting lore and timeline over at the [Star Wars Genesis Timeline](https://github.com/DeityVengy/Star-Wars-Genesis-Timeline) page (spoiler warning)

## Realistic Combat and Balancing
To avoid the poorly balanced mess of vanilla Starfield and its bullet sponge enemies, Star Wars Genesis features a custom balanced unleveled game world with an emphasis on realistic and grounded combat.
- Enemies drop all the weapons and armor they're carrying when they die
- Armor and Perk Build matters more than levels, as you now gain only 1 health per level.
- Armor defensive values are now custom balanced around a lore-accurate Armor Hierarchy, which can be seen [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10nsfWMzfDtFHDXaNGmyb3dDeQLnNtfgh/edit?gid=2113529235#gid=2113529235)
- Weapons are now more deadly, with their base ADS and hip-fire accuracy boosted.
- Perks that increase ADS and hip-fire accuracy have been reworked to actually noticeably improve accuracy to near 100% at max
- Improved and Smarter Enemy AI with more aggressive tactics based on faction and increased accuracy

## Armor Variety
Vanilla Starfield has many armors that are called different things but use the exact same Armor mesh/model. Star Wars Genesis aims to address that.
- Each individual named Armor has it's own unique armor model/mesh
- Certain NPC's have their own unique standalone armor
- Certain areas of the Galaxy have handpicked unique armors placed in it.
- Specific NPCs now have their own unique standalone armor

## Points of Interest
Starfield's POIs are one of the most controversial aspects of the game. Star Wars Genesis addresses it with countless revamps.
- Temple Ruins have been scattered around and the Galaxy and handplaced in specific locations, offering unique abilities and permanent status effects, such as reviving the dead, disarming enemies, increased endurance, etc.
- Kyber Crystals have a random chance to spawn on every planet, rewarding a skill point for every 3 collected.
- Each unique POI has a cooldown when encountered. This makes it impossible to see the same POI within hours of playing
- POI density has been greatly increased on populated planets and remained the same in desolate planets.
- 20 additional POIs have been modded into the existing POI Pool

## World
- Neon has been extensively redone, featuring more verticality, new roof level, more signage and lights, and more.
- New Atlantis now has City Lights that follow a day-night cycle
- Bigger Trees, Rocks, and other Exotics to further increase planetary variety

## Animations
- Improved 3rd person animations for pistols
- Improved lowering and raising of weapons
- Immersive Mantle Animation Speed
- Better Ragdoll Death Physics
- Removed Flailing Animation while falling (especially when using Jetpack)

## Economy
To avoid the Bethesda game stereotype where one can become unfathomably rich within the first hour of the game, the entire economy of the game has been redone.
- Selling prices of countless items have been reduced
- Prices of unique armor and weapons has been greatly increased
- The monetary rewards for missions and other tasks has been greatly increased

## Textures and Visuals
Due to the obvious VRAM and computing power limitations that consoles have, Starfield has very poor textures for a Triple A modern game release in 2023. There are also many questionable design choices regarding Visuals they have taken. These have both been addressed.
- Complete Environmental Overhaul to 2k/4k Textures, with close to no hit on performance besides VRAM usage.
- Upscaled Effect Textures (Smoke/Fire/Projectiles/etc)
- Color Corrected World
- Enhanced Clouds
- Improved Vanilla Flashlight
- Complete Climate Overhaul (Starfield vanilla planets only had a single weather option for some reason)

## HUD
Due to being releaed alongside consoles, Starfield has a very poor HUD/UI for PC users. This is addressed. 
- 60 FPS Menus
- Improved Star Map
- Enhanced Player Healthbar
- Compact Inventory UI
- Expanded Power Menu
- Zoomed Out Flight Camera
- Unified ADS Camera and FOV

## NPC and Civilian Variety
- Increased variety of civilians by introducing Alien Species
- Realistic NPC behavior, such as more observant guards, greetings, blinking, conversations, and movement

## Character Creation
- Countless new hairstyles and Beards
- Countless new presets for Alien species

## Sound Design
- Increased Music Variety beyond the vanilla limit
- Increased variety of Artifact Cutscene Dialogue
- Replaced non-binary player voice with that of a Trandoshan (non-binary voice was just default)

## Engine Fixes
Fixing the mess of Creation Engine 2
- Removal of interplanetery loading screens with a hyperspace cutscene
- Player Expression Fix
- NPC Headtracking & Makeup Fix
- Spaceuit Helmet Flashlight Fix
- Weapon Swap Stuttering Fix
- Sprint Stuttering Fix
- Crowd NPC Eye Ambient Occlusion Fix
- Sprint Headtracking Fix

## Misc
- Linked Companion Spacesuits (if you wear helmet/spacesuit, they do too)
