# Star-Wars-Genesis-Core-Gameplay-Changes

#### While striving to be a Total Conversion, Star Wars Genesis also fixes, improves, and builds upon many vanilla aspects of the game. This serves as an overview of all those changes as well a deterrent for those referring to Star Wars Genesis as simply a reskin of vanilla Starfield.

## Main Story
While also addressing the loopholes in the vanilla Starfield story, the Star Wars Genesis Main Story Conversion features many additional aspects beyond a rewrite.
- Additional mid-story Boss with Dark Souls mechanics
- Additional dialogue variety beyond vanilla Starfield
- Supporting lore and timeline over at https://github.com/DeityVengy/Star-Wars-Genesis-Timeline

## Realistic Combat and Balancing
To avoid the poorly balanced mess of vanilla Starfield, Star Wars Genesis features a custom balanced unleveled game world with an emphasis on realistic and grounded combat.
- Enemies drop all the weapons and armor they're carrying when they die
- Armor and Perk Build matters more than levels
- Weapons are now more deadly, with their base ADS and hip-fire accuracy boosted.
- Perks that increase ADS and hip-fire accuracy actually noticeably improves accuracy to near 100% at max.
- You gain 1 health per level gained


## Armor Variety
Vanilla Starfield has many armors that are called different things but use the exact same Armor mesh/model. Star Wars Genesis aims to address that.
- Each individual named Armor has it's own unique armor model/mesh
- Certain NPC's have their own unique standalone armor
- Certain areas of the Galaxy have handpicked unique armors placed in it.
